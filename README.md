This project analyzes the Netflix content dataset using Python and popular data analysis libraries. The dataset contains all TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2021, including attributes like title, director, cast, country, date added, duration, genres, and description.

The goal is to extract business insights to help Netflix understand content trends and make data-driven production decisions across different countries and genres.
